This [PHP](https://www.php.net/) script generates [PNG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNG) image with status of user on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/).  
The width of the image adjusts to the length of the username or the length of the game title the user is currently playing. The height of the image is fixed.  
Where you place the generated image is entirely up to you. In the past, people used to add such status images to their signatures on [internet forums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_forum).

## Requirements

- [PHP](https://www.php.net/) 5.6 or higher.
- [GD](https://github.com/libgd/libgd) extension enabled (version 2.X). You probably have it in your PHP extensions directory. You will need to enable it. Check this [link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2283199/enabling-installing-gd-extension-without-gd) for more information.
- [CURL](https://curl.se/) extension. Same case as with GD extension. Probably all you need to do is to enable it in your PHP configuration file.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Avaray/personal-steam-signature.git
```

> soon...

## Usage

There are two ways to configure this script:

1. With `config.php` file.
2. By passing variables as [arguments](https://www.php.net/manual/en/reserved.variables.argv.php). Config file will be ignored if you pass valid arguments.

With [CRON](https://cronitor.io/guides)

> soon...

Remotely with [HTTP Get request](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/GET)

> soon...

Then you can access your signature with URL like this:

```
https://example.com/path-to-script/76561198037068779.png
```

## Config File

You need `config.php` file only

1. Set `steam_api_key`. You can get it [here](prestashop/github-action-php-lint).
2. Set `steam_id`. You can get it from your Steam profile URL. It's 17 digits long number at the end of the URL. You can use also [this](https://steamid.info/) non-official website to get it.

```php
<?php
return [
    'steam_api_key' => 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX',
    'steam_id' => 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX',
    'capitalized_personaname' => false,
];
```

## # TODO's

- [ ] Re-write the entire script.
- [ ] Auto-creating of `config.php` file if it doesn't exist.
- [ ] Possibility to pass data in URL (use [parse_ur](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.parse-url.phpl) for that) or as [parameters](https://www.php.net/manual/en/reserved.variables.argv.php).
- [ ] Support for multiple users (up to 100).
