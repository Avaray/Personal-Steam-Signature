# Personal Steam Signature Generator (MIT license)
This PHP script generates image (PNG) with Steam status.  
This is personal script for just one user.  
Use CRON to execute this file.  

Signature looks like this (this is my current signature generated by this script):
![](https://av.execute.run/sig/sig.png)

Important steps:  
- Set Your Steam API key in line 12 // try to dont use mine because I will delete it soon
- Set Your Steam Community ID in line 13
- If you will put this script into your webhosting remember to set CHMOD 0770 for .php file (to prevent random people from executting this file)  

Would be nice to change this (if you planning to run this script from address bar in your browser):
- checkk lines 120, 125, 193

You can remove it if you want (if you dont work with Valve's Hammer Editor):
- lines from 156 to 164

## From Author:
I created this script as first (or second) PHP project ever. This was my start with programming (Thanks Simon for all your help). I cant give you a word that everything will work for you. It worked for me pretty well, but you might encounter problems, with Paths maybe (check line 90).  
This is not complete project. I abandoned this project long time ago and I will not work with it anymore.  
Right now im working with C# and NodeJS.
