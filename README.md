This [PHP](https://www.php.net/) script generates [PNG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNG) images with status of [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/) users.  
In the past, people used to add such status images to their signatures on [internet forums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_forum).

The image shows user's profile picture, username and their status or the game they are currently playing.  
The width of the image adjusts automatically. The height of the image is fixed.

_**What I can do with this script?**_  
You can use it as your personal signature generator or you can use it as a part of your website. Maybe you will launch a website where people can generate their own signatures? IDK, if you are reading this, you probably have some idea.

## Requirements

- [PHP](https://www.php.net/) 5.3 or higher. Badges above currently shows [Lint](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)>) status of `php -l`.
- [GD](https://github.com/libgd/libgd) extension. Depending on your server configuration, this will either be enabled or disabled. Check this [link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2283199/enabling-installing-gd-extension-without-gd) for more information on how to enable it.
- [CURL](https://curl.se/) extension. Same case as with GD extension. If it's not enabled, enable it.

Except that you need [Steam API Key](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey). You can get it for free if your account [is not limited](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/71D3-35C2-AD96-AA3A).

## Installation

You can [clone](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone/en) this repository using [Git](https://git-scm.com/) or [GitHub Desktop](https://github.com/apps/desktop) or any other [Git client](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Avaray/personal-steam-signature.git
```

Or you can download this repository as a [ZIP archive](https://github.com/Avaray/personal-steam-signature/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) and extract it to your desired location.

## Configuration

Basically all you need is to provide [Steam API Key](https://steamcommunity.com/dev) and at least one [Steam ID](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/SteamID) to get started.  
You can do that in three ways.

### By editing `config.json` file.

```json
{
  "keys": ["A1C3", "B2D4"],
  "ids": ["7284", "6130"]
}
```

### By passing variables as arguments.

> In this case you need to split `ids` with comma `,`.

```bash
php sig.php keys=A1C3,B2D4 ids=7284,6130
```

### By passing variables as URL parameters.

> This method requires properly configured web server.  
> If you will keep this script in public directory, make sure you are not exposing your `config.json` file.

```
https://domain.com/?keys=A1C3,B2D4&ids=7284,6130
```

### API Keys in Environment Variable

You can also set your API Keys as `STEAM_API_KEYS` environment variable. Script will read it.

```bash
export STEAM_API_KEYS="A1C3,B2D4"
```

You can check configuration flow [here](FLOW.md) to see how the script searches for configuration.

### Loading IDs from file

If you want to load IDs from [JSON](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_arrays.asp) file, that file should contain one valid array of IDs.  
In all other file types you can separate IDs by anything you want (new line, space, symbol, letter). The only requirement is that IDs should not be encrypted or encoded in any way.

If you have IDs in `config.json` and in `input_file`, and maybe you passed some IDs as arguments, all of them will be used. Duplicated IDs will be removed.

## Usage

### With Process Manager

If you are planning to use this script for a long time for a large number of users, I would recommend running it with Process Manager (like [PM2](https://github.com/Unitech/pm2), [Servicer](https://servicer.dev/), [systemd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemd) and similar) that will restart it if it crashes. I'm working hard to make this script as stable as possible, but you never know what can happen. Even if script will run perfectly, it's good to use such tools.

For this you also need to set `self_running` to `true` in `config.json` file.

### With Cron

If you are planning to use this script for a small number of users (maybe just for yourself), you can run it with [Cron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron).  
[Crontab.guru](https://crontab.guru/) will help you to create a cron schedule expression. [Cronitor.io](https://cronitor.io/guides/cron-jobs) have some useful guides about cron jobs.

```bash
# Run script every 5 minutes
*/5 * * * * /path/to/executable/php /path/to/sig.php
```

**Not recommended use is to hold files of this script in public web directory. If you do so, make sure you are not exposing files containing sensitive data like file with Steam API Key or files with IDs.** Remember that anyone can run this script if they know the URL. That might lead to flooding your server. There are ways to prevent this, but it's better to keep this script in a private directory and use other methods to execute it.

## Notes

Keep in mind that there is limit of `100,000` requests per day for Steam API. If you are planning to use this script for a large number of users, you should calculate how often you can run this script. Maximum number of users to check in one request is `100`. So if you have `1000` users, you will need to make `10` requests in one run. So, in this example you can perform entire operation every `‚âà 8.64 seconds` to not exceed the limit. By default, script calculates minimal interval to prevent exceeding the limit.

Dealing with many users can be heavy for your server. If you are planning to use this script as part of a public service, you should consider using good hosting provider. Free service providers may ban your account if you exceed their limits. Let's do another calculation. You have `100,000` user IDs. You are running script with interval of `60` seconds. Status od `10%` of users changes. Assuming that single avatar weight is `25KB`, you will generate about `1TB` of traffic in one month. That's a lot. And that's only traffic generated by retrieving avatars. You should also consider traffic generated by script itself. Let's continue. Retrieving data for `100,000` users is about `72MB` in the best case. In one month it will be about `3TB` of traffic. Plus count all incoming requests for generated images. So, be aware of these values and the potential costs associated with them if you're planning a large project.

Currently I'm thinking on workaround to heavily significantly reduce generated traffic. There is one option that might also bring some new possibilities, but I need to do some experiments to see if it's worth it.

When you run the script for the first time, it will generate statuses for all IDs. This can take a lot of time and machine resources. On next runs, it will only generate them for people whose statuses have changed.

Process of generating images can take some time. Next process will not start until the previous one is finished. So don't expect that interval will be always the same. Let's say you need to generate images for `180` users. It takes `1` second to generate image for one user. Even if you set interval to `60` seconds, it will take `3` minutes to generate images for all users. Then next process will start immediately.

Due to your [server configuration](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_(computing)>), users browser [caching](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_(computing)>), and other factors, you (and your users) may experience issues with images not refreshing as expected. This script have no control over these factors.

## TODO's

- [ ] Script is fetching data for all IDs (no matter for how many).
- [ ] Script is able to generate image.
- [ ] Workflow for generating example images.
- [x] Cleanups for IDs that are not used anymore.
- [ ] Customizations for individual IDs.
- [x] Allow to use any kind of file for IDs.
- [ ] Possibility to pass all options as arguments.
- [x] Possibility to use multiple Steam API Keys to reduce interval with large number of users.
